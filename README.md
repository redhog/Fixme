Simple too to extracts FIXME comments from source code. Supports both normal one-liners like

    # FIXME: This is broken

as well as a more complex format allowing tagging and categorization of problems:

    # #### fixme ####
    # name = 'foo'
    # blahonga = """xx
    # yy
    # zz"""
    # naja = 1
    # #### end ####
